## What Works

- **HackerNews scraping**: Fetches posts from HackerNews, parses them and saves to CSV
- **GitHub stars fetching**: Logic is implemented to fetch star data from GitHub API

## What Doesn't Work

- **Saving star data**: The logic to save fetched GitHub stars to file is broken

## Data Analysis

Basic title analytics in `ds.ipynb` notebook. Didn't have time to do more.

Output saved to `data/` directory as CSV files.
